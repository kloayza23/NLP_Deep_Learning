# Analsis of natural language processing with deep learning #

The main contribuition of this project is the use of the deep learning tools in their application in the NLP projects.

## Outline ##

#### Concepts of natural language processing ####
	Here is explained the importance of the natural language processing and their appliances.
#### Concepts of Deep Learning ####
	Here is explained the types of tools of deep learning as LSTM or Convolutional neural networks, and how
	this tools can be used in the NLP projects.
